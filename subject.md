## Goals

- Learn basic shell commands and file system navigation.
- Understand file permissions and attributes.
- Master version control concepts with Git.
- Practice shell scripting and command-line tools.
- Develop system administration skills.

---

## General Requirements

- Exercises must be executable with `/bin/sh`.
- Follow the submission procedures for every exercise.
- Exercises are ordered by difficulty - easier ones must be completed first.
- Ensure appropriate permissions on files and directories.
- No additional files beyond those specified in the subject.
- Evaluation includes peer reviews and automated testing via **Moulinette**.
- Reference materials: Google, man pages, the Internet, forum discussions.

## Exercise 00 - Z

**Turn-in directory:** `ex00/`  
**Files to turn in:** `z`  
**Allowed functions:** None

Create a file called `z` that returns "Z" followed by a newline when using the `cat` command.

**Expected output:**
```bash
?> cat z
Z
?>
```

## Exercise 01 - testShell00

**Turn-in directory:** `ex01/`  
**Files to turn in:** `testShell00.tar`  
**Allowed functions:** None

Create a file called `testShell00` with specific permissions to match this output:

```bash
%> ls -l
total 1
-r--r-xr-x 1 XX XX 40 Jun 1 23:42 testShell00
%>
```

Once achieved, create the submission file:
```bash
tar -cf testShell00.tar testShell00
```

> Note: "XX" values and timestamp variations are acceptable.

---

## Exercise 02 - Oh yeah, mooore...

**Turn-in directory:** `ex02/`  
**Files to turn in:** `exo2.tar`  
**Allowed functions:** None

Create files and directories to match this exact `ls -l` output:

```bash
%> ls -l
total XX
drwx--xr-x 2 XX XX XX Jun 1 20:47 test0
-rwx--xr-- 1 XX XX 4 Jun 1 21:46 test1
dr-x---r-- 2 XX XX XX Jun 1 22:45 test2
-r-----r-- 2 XX XX 1 Jun 1 23:44 test3
-rw-r----x 1 XX XX 2 Jun 1 23:43 test4
-r-----r-- 2 XX XX 1 Jun 1 23:44 test5
lrwxr-xr-x 1 XX XX 5 Jun 1 22:20 test6 -> test0
%>
```

Create submission file: `tar -cf exo2.tar *`

---

## Exercise 03 - Connect me!

**Turn-in directory:** `ex03/`  
**Files to turn in:** `klist.txt`  
**Allowed functions:** None

Ensure you have a valid (non-expired) Kerberos ticket, then write a list of all your tickets into `klist.txt`.

> Note: These commands will be useful later - remember them!

---

## Exercise 04 - midLS

**Turn-in directory:** `ex04/`  
**Files to turn in:** `midLS`  
**Allowed functions:** None

Create a `midLS` file containing a command that lists all files and directories in the current directory:
- Exclude hidden files (starting with dots, including `.`)
- Separate entries with commas
- Order by creation date
- Add slash `/` after directory names
- Show only what's requested

---

## Exercise 05 - GiT commit

**Turn-in directory:** `ex05/`  
**Files to turn in:** `git_commit.sh`  
**Allowed functions:** None

Create a shell script that displays the IDs of the last 5 commits from your git repository.

**Expected output:**
```bash
%> bash git_commit.sh | cat -e
baa23b54f0adb7bf42623d6d0a6ed4587e11412a$
2f52d74b1387fa80eea844969e8dc5483b531ac1$

## Exercise 06 - gitignore

**Turn-in directory:** `ex06/`  
**Files to turn in:** `git_ignore.sh`  
**Allowed functions:** None

Write a shell script that lists all existing files ignored by your Git repository.

## Exercise 07 - diff

**Turn-in directory:** `ex07/`  
**Files to turn in:** `b`  
**Allowed functions:** None

Reference the provided file `a` with Star Wars content. Use `man patch` for guidance.

---

## Exercise 08 - clean

**Turn-in directory:** `ex08/`  
**Files to turn in:** `clean`  
**Allowed functions:** None

Create a file called `clean` containing a single command that:
- Searches current directory and subdirectories
- Finds files ending with `~`
- Finds files starting and ending with `#`
- Shows and erases all found files
- Uses only one command (no `;`, `&&`, or other operators)

Reference: `man find`

## Exercise 09 - Illusions, not tricks, Michael...

**Turn-in directory:** `ex09/`  
**Files to turn in:** `ft_magic`
